# DeathCam - *RPH Plugin*

RAGE Plugin Hook Plugin that disables the automatic respawn system on character death, and allows you to observe your surroundings freely.

## How it works
After your character dies, you can move the camera around with the arrow keys and mouse (or with a controller). You can also zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.  
Press the `Jump` key/button to reappear.
