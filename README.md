# DeathCam - *RPH Plugin*

RAGE Plugin Hook Plugin that disables the automatic respawn system on character death, and allows you to observe your surroundings freely.

## How it works
After your character dies, you can move the camera around with the arrow keys and mouse (or with a controller).  
Use the <kbd>Stealth Mode</kbd> control to increase the camera movement speed. <small>(Previously <kbd>Sprint</kbd>, but wasn't detected correctly)</small>  
You can also zoom in and out with the scroll wheel or the <kbd>Phone Up</kbd>/<kbd>Phone Down</kbd> controls.  
Press the <kbd>Jump</kbd> control to reappear.
